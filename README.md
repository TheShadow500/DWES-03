Online Computer Store - Example

Example website for DWES practices
Online Computer Store. Works with a Database

It only functions as an example, without users or data manipulation.

The unique function is to add items to the shopping cart and view information about each one.

It uses sessions to remember the contents of the shopping cart.

INSTALLATION
Upon accessing install.php, it automatically creates the database and also imports a .csv file (included) into the database as an example, inserting items.
